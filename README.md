‚è±Ô∏è TimeTrack Pro - Chrome Extension for Time Tracking & Productivity Analytics
TimeTrack Pro is an innovative Chrome extension designed to help users understand and improve their online productivity. This powerful tool automatically tracks time spent on different websites and provides detailed insights into browsing habits. By categorizing websites as productive or unproductive, users gain valuable awareness of their daily internet usage patterns and make informed decisions about their online time management.

The extension operates seamlessly in the background, monitoring active website usage and automatically categorizing domains based on predefined lists. For instance, websites like GitHub, Stack Overflow, and LinkedIn are marked as productive, while social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are categorized as unproductive. Users can easily customize these categories through an intuitive options interface, adding or removing websites to match their personal productivity goals.

One of the extension's standout features is its real-time tracking system, which not only monitors web URLs but also tracks time spent on local files like PDFs and documents. The tracking mechanism is sophisticated enough to handle tab switching, browser window changes, and system sleep states, ensuring accurate time measurements even during complex browsing sessions.
